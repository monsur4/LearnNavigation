# LearnNavigation
Using Drawer Navigation -- Method 1
As part of my preparation for the Associate associate android developer exam. This program highlights how to implement the navigation under the Androidx library.
However, this program doesn't use the NavController, NavHost, NavUI classes.
Check out another repository <strong>AnotherNavigation</strong> where the Navigation Drawer is implemented using these classes
